# ABCNoteParser
Plays a song from an ABC Notation string.

It requires the Sox play command. For Windows, you will have to go with the older
14.4.1 version.
- Install Sox.
- In the file browser, copy sox.exe.
- Paste it in the same directory.
- Rename the copy to "play".

If you are using Visual Studio, uncomment lines 4 and 93.
